# Bacteria/Macrophage Simulation

An agent based and next-event simulation that uses a cell grid to simulate movement, division, and eating over time.

### Running the Project

To run this project, compile all java files and run Tester.  Values within Tester can be changed to create different simulations.
Two windows will display when the simulation is run. One will show the macrophage and bacteria in a grid and their movement along with a count of each. The other window shows a graph of the number of bacteria and macrophage over time.

### About

This project was a part of my Simulation class, taught by Dr. Barry Lawson.
